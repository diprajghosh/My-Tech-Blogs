*Without using github codespace.*

Find an exciting project and wished that you could navigate the included source code quickly?

GitHub added a lot of shortcuts and stuff over the years, but how great would it be if you could open files side-by-side.

That all seems to be offered by [**github1s**](https://github.com/conwnet/github1s).

When you’re on a GitHub repository [`github.com/someperson/someproject`](http://github.com/someperson/someproject) add `1s` to the URL ([`github1s.com/someperson/someproject`](http://github1s.com/someperson/someproject)) and boom! Find VS Code in your browser ready to inspect some code. 🤯👏
